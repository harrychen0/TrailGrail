## Installation

Make sure you have node installed first, then run:

```bash
npm install
```

The app uses Cloudinary for image storage, MongoDB to store entries of trails, and Mapbox to store geo-data for each trail. Feel free to create your own accounts and API keys to add to a .env file inthe root directory to use the project on your own machine: otherwise check out the demo link above!

If running on local, run:
```bash
node app.js
```
